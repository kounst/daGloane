The target is to make the daGloane qaudcopter controlable using a Android Smartphone.
For now to ease devolempent a common RC remote control will be used.
daGloane_remote is a stm32_discovery eval board and a bluetooth interface that connects to a RC remote control. 
It will read the PPM signal of the remote and transfer the channel information via bluetooth to daGloane.
